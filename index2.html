      <h2>AI Is No Longer Science Fiction</h2>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence is becoming deeply integrated into our daily lives, often without us even realizing it. From your phone unlocking with your face to the suggestions you get while shopping online — AI is working silently in the background.</p>

      <h3>Where AI Is Already Present</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant</li>
        <li>Recommendation engines in Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon</li>
        <li>Healthcare diagnostics and wearable tech</li>
        <li>AI cameras in smartphones</li>
        <li>Smart home devices</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Is AI Helping or Replacing Us?</h3>
      <p>AI is meant to enhance human ability, not replace it. When used responsibly, it can make life easier, more efficient, and even safer.</p>

      <blockquote>
        “AI will not replace humans, but those who use AI will replace those who don’t.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>It’s important to stay informed and involved in how AI is evolving — because it’s shaping our future in real-time.</p>
